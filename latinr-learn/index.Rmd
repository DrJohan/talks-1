# But things have changed.

We are in a global pandemic.

Learning does not feel so great now.

Asking for help does not feel so great right now.

# What do I do?

--

Today, I'll share my own strategies for learning without a net. 

--

Every time I do it, it is scary.

--

But also every time I do it, I get better at it.

--

And having a system helps.

# Delivery of orientations

--

+ Webinars

--

+ First bit of a workshop

--

+ First lecture of a course

--

+ Early chapter(s) of a book

# Stage 1: Get oriented

--

+ .emphasis[Search!] Try adding *"intro to"* or *"for beginners"* &mdash; this is where you are.

--

+ .emphasis[Ask!] *"Can you share 3 or 4 key blog posts or resources that you recommend as starting points?"*<br>(also works for forums like Discourse, Slack, Twitter)


--

+ .emphasis[Edit!] Be very picky here- you'll likely have options. Pick friendly voices. Select for kindness.

# Lessons that build mental models

--

+ A .emphasis[tutorial] is a planned lesson designed to help you build a mental model.

--

+ A .emphasis[worked example] shows you how to solve a specific problem, but a good one also conveys something more generalizable.


---
template: clouds
class: middle

# Stage 3: Building mental models

--

+ .emphasis[Search!] Try adding *"how to"* or *"tutorial"* along with keywords to help you filter (like R package names)

--

+ .emphasis[Show up!] Find a workshop to attend

--

+ .emphasis[Ask!] *"Can you share 3 or 4 key blog posts or resources that you recommend about `_____`?"*<br>(also works for forums like Discourse, Slack, Twitter)

--

+ .emphasis[Edit!] Again, someone you want to spend time with.

# A "good" tutorial

--

+ Good .emphasis[scope] (not too broad, not too narrow)

--

+ Good .emphasis[structure] (information is chunked sensibly)

--

+ Good .emphasis[sequencing] (order helps, not hurts)

--

+ Good .emphasis[successes] baked in (just enough)
